    "Quantile loss is a loss function used in quantile regression, which models the relationship between the predictor variables and specific quantiles of the target variable. Quantile loss measures the differences between the predicted quantiles and the corresponding actual quantiles. It is particularly useful when the focus is on estimating conditional quantiles of the target variable, such as estimating median or upper/lower percentiles. The specific formulation of quantile loss depends on the desired quantile level."

As a result, squared loss is more sensitive to outliers and can amplify their impact, while absolute loss is more robust to outliers but may be less efficient in estimating the underlying relationships when the error distribution is not symmetric.\n",

Hard margin SVM seeks to find a decision boundary that perfectly separates the classes with no misclassifications, assuming the data is linearly separable. Soft margin SVM relaxes this constraint and allows for some misclassifications by introducing slack variables. Soft margin SVM is more flexible and robust to noisy or overlapping data, while hard margin SVM can be sensitive to outliers and noisy samples."
